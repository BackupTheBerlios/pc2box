High priority:

* Linux: Fix buffer overflow when compiled with -O2

Medium priority:
* Linux: Program currently increments device file names forever
  if no device is found in sdb-sdz range. Ideally it should
  wrap around to achieve constant device polling

* Linux: If more than one device with LaSat FS is connected, only
  one (the first in the sequence of device files) will be recognized
