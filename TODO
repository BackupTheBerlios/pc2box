Medium priority:
* Linux: Add support for multiple devices with LaSat FS
         If more than one device with LaSat FS is connected, only
         one (the first in the sequence of device files) will be recognized
* Linux: Open disk read/write to enable file upload to box ("pc2box")

* Windows: Improper return code handling for VfsGetMediaInfo
           STATUS_SUCCESS is 0, but code in Poll_vfs() continues in case of 
           non-zero return code
* Windows: replace "0xdeadbeef" with an instance specific string

* All: Fix bFile handling, currently not initialized on Windows
* All: Decouple synchronization from file locking
* All: Eliminate timing-based synchronization (msleep()) if possible
* All: Prevent multiple file list updates during startup

Low priority:
* All: pc2box does not store EPG from REC file to device
