Medium priority:
* All: Segmentation fault when cancelling REC->TS conversion at 100%
* All: Intermittent deadlock when cancelling REC->TS conversion, especially
       when running under gdb
* All: Check if transfer speed can be enhanced by reducing the 10ms delay 
       between each data chunk and the 100ms delay between each file
       Ideally: Eliminate timing-based synchronization (msleep()) entirely
       if possible
* All: Decouple synchronization from file locking

Low priority:
* All: Prevent multiple file list updates during startup
* All: Localization (support for multiple UI languages)

Ideas for future enhancements:
* All: Add support for multiple devices with LaSat FS
       If multiple devices with LaSat FS are connected, currently only
       one (the first in the sequence of device files) will be recognized
       This may require a significant UI change to associate titles to
       devices (tree view)
       Windows: Check the "0xdeadbeef" driver will support multiple devices
* All: New functionality to delete files on device
* All: Add EPG content editor
