Medium priority:
* All: Check if transfer speed can be enhanced by reducing the 10ms delay between
       each data chunk and the 100ms delay between each file
* All: Add support for multiple devices with LaSat FS
       If multiple devices with LaSat FS are connected, currently only
       one (the first in the sequence of device files) will be recognized
       Windows: Clarify if this can be done through the "0xdeadbeef" handle
* All: Let users select REC files for pc2box (upload) rather than taking all
       REC files within the current directory
* All: Resolve pc2box (upload) file name issues
       a) File name on disk too long for LaSat FS
       b) File name not unique on LaSat FS
* All: Fix bFile handling, currently not initialized on Windows
* All: Decouple synchronization from file locking
* All: Eliminate timing-based synchronization (msleep()) entirely if possible

Low priority:
* All: Prevent multiple file list updates during startup

Ideas for future extensions:
* All: Show EPG information for selected recording
* All: New functionality to delete files on device
* All: Add EPG content editor
