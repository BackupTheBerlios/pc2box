High priority:

* Linux: Fix program crash when transferring multiple files (on fast systems)
         Background: While it is working on an old, slow Notebook as well as on
	 a very recent & fast Notebook, multi-file transfer crashes with
	 segmentation fault on a very fast Desktop PC that is equipped with
	 a very fast SSD drive. Probably a race condition.
 
Medium priority:
* Linux: If more than one device with LaSat FS is connected, only
  one (the first in the sequence of device files) will be recognized
* Windows: Improper return code handling for VfsGetMediaInfo
* All: Fix bFile handling
* All: Decouple synchronization from file locking
